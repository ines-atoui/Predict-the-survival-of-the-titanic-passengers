# Predict-the-survival-of-the-titanic-passengers
This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic. It uses a dataset of Titanic passenger information, including features like age, gender, class, and more, to build and train a predictive model.


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, and passenger class. Several machine learning models are used for this prediction, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

## Data Overview

The project uses the Titanic passenger dataset, which includes information about passengers such as name, age, sex, ticket class, cabin, and whether they survived or not.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes. The accuracy of the Logistic Regression model on the test dataset is calculated.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors is a classification algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors. The optimal number of neighbors is determined, and the model's accuracy is evaluated.

### 3. Decision Tree

Decision Tree is a tree-like structure used for classification. Two variations of Decision Tree models are used, one with the Gini criterion and another with the entropy criterion. The decision tree structure is visualized.

### 4. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. The number of estimators is varied to observe its impact on accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each machine learning model is evaluated using accuracy and visualizations, such as confusion matrices and ROC curves. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and AUC (Area Under the Curve) are used to assess model performance.

## Summary

The project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset and explores the predictive capabilities of various machine learning models. It provides insights into feature importance and demonstrates the impact of model parameters on accuracy.
